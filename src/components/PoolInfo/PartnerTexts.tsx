      <h2>American Horror Finance</h2>
      <p>American Horror Finance (AHF) is more than just a meme token.</p>
      <p>
        It has a goal, a purpose to combat fraud and scams.As a developer, Shades got enough knowledge to detect scammers and warn
        people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, American Horror Finance will be creating a whole ecosystem of alliances and partnerships with legit new projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        As this ecosystem grows, AHF holders will benefit by getting perk from different projects, and in return , projects get
        notoriet to being legitimate and occasional tax redistribution perks from our treasury to their holders.
      </p>
      <h4>How it works ?</h4>
      <p>
        1.American Horror Finance will have very low supply, with 5% tax. <br />
        <br />
        2. This 5% tax happens on each transactions made.
        <br />
        <br />
        3. This 5% will be transmitted to a treasury/tax address.
        <br />
        <br />
        4. Randomly, every 2 days, this treasury address will be redistributed to top 15 holders, and 5 randomly generated lucky
        holder (anywhere on the etherscan list).
        <br />
        <br />
        5. The distribution is percentage of holding based to make it fair.

      <h2>Coronadefi - CORD</h2>
      <p>
        Coronadefis vision is based on giving back to the community. For the first time there is something in the Crypto market
        which speaks about giving back and helping the community we live in.
      </p>
      <h3>How do we plan on achieving that?</h3>
      <p>
        Well for starters we will be donating 10% of the $CORD which is up to 1,900 coins to a red cross foundation, transaction
        details will be posted on the website and telegram.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from that it has come to our recent attention about the ongoing rugpulls that a lot of the investors went through
        and lost a fortune on.
      </p>
      <h4>We as a ‘community coin’ decided to bring trust into the Crypto market again.</h4>

      <h2>Sergey Save(d) Link</h2>
      <p>
        Started off as a meme token with zero utility aka shitcoin. With no website, no dApp. Literally nothing, just a token. On
        Sep 24, around 8PM UTC is when $LINK started making a comeback from its bottom! Many were concerned about the correction
        and bearish market. But you know what happened next, we saw a sudden climb all the way back to $10 in matter of 24hours.
        Me as a normal guy who loves $LINK, was totally excited that day!
      </p>
      <p>
        They created this token in the name of "Sergey Saved Link" to convey the message "Sergey saved us by buying the weak hand
        bags". Just a meme. This random useless shitcoin with zero utility was airdropped to members who joined the TG group. All
        necessary history is there in the announcement channel. You can find how all this started.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spinned up the website very next day, finalised the utility and dApp which was my own suggestion. Engaged few core members
        from Zilliqa team to help us and bring this forward. Requested their assistance for dApp and they are happy to help! Thats
        about it. Follow the SSL announcement channel and keep yourself updated on the progress.
